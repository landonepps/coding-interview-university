### Arrays and Strings

 - [ ] 1.1 - Is Unique (p.192)
    - Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?
    - Hints: #44, #117, #132

  - [ ] 1.8 - Zero Matrix (p.204)
    - Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and column are set to 0.
    - Hints: #17, #74, #702

### 1.9 - String Rotation (p.206)
  - Assume you have a method isSubstring which checks if one word is a substring of another. Given two strings, s1 and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to isSubstring (e.g.,"waterbottle" is a rotation of"erbottlewat").
  - Hints: #34, #88, #104

### 2.1 - Remove Dups (p.208)
  - Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.
  - FOLLOW UP: How would you solve this problem if a temporary buffer is not allowed?
  - Hints: #9, #40

### 3.2 - Stack Min (pg.232)
 - How would you design a stack which, in addition to push and pop, has a function min which returns the minimum element? Push, pop and min should all operate in O(1) time.
 - Hints:#27, #59, #78
