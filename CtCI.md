### Arrays and Strings

 - [ ] 1.1 - Is Unique (p.192)
    - Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?
    - Hints: #44, #117, #132

  - [ ] 1.8 - Zero Matrix (p.204)
    - Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and column are set to 0.
    - Hints: #17, #74, #702

  - [ ] 1.9 - String Rotation (p.206)
    - Assume you have a method `isSubstring` which checks if one word is a substring of another. Given two strings, `s1` and `s2`, write code to check if `s2` is a rotation of `s1` using only one call to `isSubstring` (e.g.,"waterbottle" is a rotation of "erbottlewat").
    - Hints: #34, #88, #104

### Linked Lists

  - [ ] 2.1 - Remove Dups (p.208)
    - Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.
    - FOLLOW UP: How would you solve this problem if a temporary buffer is not allowed?
    - Hints: #9, #40

### Stacks and Queues

  - [ ] 3.2 - Stack Min (pg.232)
    - How would you design a stack which, in addition to `push` and `pop`, has a function `min` which returns the minimum element? `Push`, `pop` and `min` should all operate in `O(1)` time.
    - Hints:#27, #59, #78

  - [ ] 3.3 - Stack of Plates (p.233)
    -  Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might topple. Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack exceeds some threshold. Implement a data structure `SetOfStacks` that mimics this. `SetOfStacks` should be composed of several stacks and should create a new stack once the previous one exceeds capacity. `SetOfStacks.push()` and `SetOfStacks.pop()` should behave identically to a single stack (that is, `pop()` should return the same values as it would if there were just a single stack).
    - FOLLOW UP: Implement a function `popAt(int index)` which performs a pop operation on a specific sub-stack.
    Hints: #64, #81

  - [ ] 3.4 - Queue via Stacks (p.236)
    - Implement a `MyQueue` class which implements a queue using two stacks.
    - Hints: #98, #114

  - [ ] 3.6 - Animal Shelter (p.239)
    - An animal shelter, which holds only dogs and cats, operates on a strictly "first in, first out" basis. People must adopt either the "oldest" (based on arrival time) of all animals at the shelter, or they can select whether they would prefer a dog or a cat (and will receive the oldest animal of that type). They cannot select which specific animal they would like. Create the data structures to maintain this system and implement operations such as `enqueue`, `dequeueAny`, `dequeueDog`, and `dequeueCat`. You may use the built-in `LinkedList` data structure.
    - Hints: #22, #56, #63

### Trees and Graphs

  - [ ] 4.4 - Check Balanced (p.244)
    - Implement a function to check if a binary tree is balanced. For the purposes of this question, a balanced tree is defined to be a tree such that the heights of the two subtrees of any node never differ by more than one.
    - Hints: #21, #33, #49, #105, #124

  - [ ] 4.1 - Route Between Nodes (p.241)
    - Given a directed graph, design an algorithm to find out whether there is a route between two nodes.
    - Hints: #127

  - [ ] 4.2 - Minimal Tree (p.242)
    - Given a sorted (increasing order) array with unique integer elements, write an algoÂ­rithm to create a binary search tree with minimal height.
    - Hints: #19, #73, #116]

  - [ ] 4.5 - Validate BST (p.246)
    - Implement a function to check if a binary tree is a binary search tree.
    - Hints: #35, #57, #86, #113, #128

  - [ ] 4.6 - Successor (p.248)
    - Write an algorithm to find the "next" node (i.e., in-order successor) of a given node in a binary search tree. You may assume that each node has a link to its parent.
    - Hints: #79, #91

  - [ ] 4.10 - Check Subtree (p.265)
    - `T1` and `T2` are two very large binary trees, with `T1` much bigger than `T2`. Create an algorithm to determine if `T2` is a subtree of `T1`.
    - A tree `T2` is a subtree of `T1` if there exists a node n in `T1` such that the subtree of n is identical to `T2`. That is, if you cut off the tree at node n, the two trees would be identical.
    - Hints: #4, #11, #18, #31, #37
